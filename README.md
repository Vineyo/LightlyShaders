# LightlyShaders v3.0
 This is a fork of Luwx's [LightlyShaders](https://github.com/Luwx/LightlyShaders), which in turn is a fork of [ShapeCorners](https://sourceforge.net/projects/shapecorners/).  

 **It now also includes a fork of KWin Blur effect to fix the "korner bug".** It is disabled by default, you will have to enter Effects settings, disable the stock blur and enable the one with the "LightlyShaders" lable.

 This effect works correctly with stock Plasma effects.

# Warning:

**This is a work in progress branch!**
It may crash, contain new bugs, require installation of additional development packages to compile or not compile for you at all!

To build on Plasma 6 RC1 you may have to download **effect/xcb.h** header manually (see [related bugreport](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=479584)).

This branch is expected to work with any window decoration and theme.

# Dependencies:
 
Plasma >= 6.0.
 
You will need qt6, kf6 and kwin development packages.

# Manual installation
```
git clone https://github.com/a-parhom/LightlyShaders

cd LightlyShaders;

git checkout plasma6;

mkdir qt6build; cd qt6build; cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr && make && sudo make install
```

## Note
After some updates of Plasma this plugin may need to be recompiled in order to work with changes introduced to KWin.
